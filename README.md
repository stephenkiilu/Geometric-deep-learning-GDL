### Introduction
As part of the [African Master’s in Machine Intelligence (AMMI 2022)](https://aimsammi.org/), we have delivered a course on Geometric Deep Learing (GDL100), which closely follows the contents of our [GDL proto-book](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478). We make all materials and artefacts from this course publicly available, as companion material for our proto-book, as well as a way to dive deeper into some of the contents for future iterations of the book ~ Michael M. Bronstein, Joan Bruna, Taco Cohen, Petar Veličković.

### Course materials

All materials including recordings, slides, practicals (Colab) and guest lectures can found at [Geometric deep learning website](https://geometricdeeplearning.com/lectures/).

### Requirements

For practical sessions, a working [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) setup is required. Course material will be done in python.
