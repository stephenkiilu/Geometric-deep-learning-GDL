### Introduction
As part of the [African Masterâ€™s in Machine Intelligence (AMMI 2021)](https://aimsammi.org/), we have delivered a course on Geometric Deep Learing (GDL100), which closely follows the contents of our GDL proto-book. We make all materials and artefacts from this course publicly available, as companion material for our proto-book, as well as a way to dive deeper into some of the contents for future iterations of the book.

### Course Slides

Slides for the course can be found here: [Slides](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/svn/kernelcourse/slides/ammi2020/ammi2020.pdf)

### Requirements

For practical sessions, a working [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) setup is required. Course material will be done in python.
